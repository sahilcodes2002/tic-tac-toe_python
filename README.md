# tic-tac-toe_python

This Python project implements a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe where you can play against an AI opponent. The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make the best possible moves, ensuring a challenging and fun gaming experience.

Features
Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer opponent with an AI based on the minimax algorithm.
Choose your side: You can play as "X" or "O" against the AI.
Real-time game board display in the console.
Automatic detection of the game result: win, lose, or draw.
Beautifully designed game board for an enhanced user experience.
Getting Started
Prerequisites: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.


Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.
Try to beat the computer opponent using your best strategy!
How It Works
The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move in the game. Minimax is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player games, which seeks to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario while maximizing the potential gain. In Tic-Tac-Toe, this allows the AI to make strategic moves and play a competitive game.
